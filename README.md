## 🏆 Hackathon

NexusResponse was created as a submission for the **Build with AI — Google Solution Challenge 2026**, an initiative by Google and GDG (Google Developer Groups), hosted on **Hack2Skill**.

> 🔗 **Event Link**: [hack2skill.com/event/build-with-ai](https://hack2skill.com/event/build-with-ai?tab=solutionchallenge2026)

This project demonstrates:
- Real-world use of **Google Gemini** for AI-powered emergency response
- Integration with **Google Cloud Platform** and **Firebase** as the cloud backbone
- Prompt engineering and rapid prototyping via **Google AI Studio**
- Enterprise-grade AI scalability through **Google Vertex AI**
- Accelerated agentic development with **Google DeepMind's Antigravity**

## 🏗️ System Architecture

NexusResponse is built on a modern, decoupled cloud architecture utilizing Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and advanced Generative AI services. The diagram below illustrates the platform flow and component boundaries:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph client_tier["Client Tier (User Interfaces)"]
        AdminHub["Operations Control Hub / Sentinel UI<br/>(React & Tailwind CSS)"]
        GuestPortal["Guest Guide / SafeStay Portal<br/>(React & Framer Motion)"]
    end

    subgraph cloud_infra["Serverless & Cloud Infrastructure (GCP)"]
        Auth["Firebase Authentication<br/>(Anonymous Guest Auth)"]
        Firestore[("Firebase Firestore<br/>(Real-Time Database)")]
    end

    subgraph ai_engine["Generative AI Engine"]
        Gemini["Google Gemini API & Vertex AI<br/>(Evacuation Route Generator)"]
    end

    %% Interactions
    AdminHub <-->|Real-time Sync| Firestore
    GuestPortal <-->|Real-time Sync| Firestore
    GuestPortal -->|Anonymous Auth| Auth
    AdminHub -->|Trigger Mock Crisis / Evacuation| Firestore
    Firestore -->|Contextual Hazard Data| Gemini
    Gemini -->|Structured Route Guidance| GuestPortal
```

### Architectural Breakdown:
- **Client Tier**: Separate interfaces for administrators (Sentinel UI) and guests (SafeStay Portal).
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Firebase handles real-time state synchronization, reducing latency to milliseconds, and manages quick anonymous sessions for guests in crisis zones.
- **Generative AI Engine**: Powered by Google Gemini and Google Cloud's Vertex AI to read building layouts, locate hazard zones, and dynamically compute safe evacuation pathways.

## 🔬 How It Works

### Crisis Detection Pipeline

1. **Threat Reported**: A critical threat (e.g. fire, structural damage) is manually entered or triggered via mock simulation.
2. **Database Logging**: The incident details are immediately written to Firebase Firestore.
3. **Admin Alerting**: The real-time listeners on the Sentinel Dashboard update all connected operations terminals instantly.
4. **Guest Broadcast**: Automated emergency signals are dispatched to all guest SafeStay instances.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Admin as Crisis Administrator / Drill System
    participant DB as Firebase Firestore
    participant AI as Google Gemini / Vertex AI
    actor Guest as SafeStay Guest Portal

    Admin->>DB: Report threat (e.g., Fire in Sector Alpha)
    Note over DB: Trigger real-time Firestore listeners
    DB-->>Guest: Broadcast Alert: Evacuation Protocol Engaged
    Guest->>DB: Retrieve building layout & current hazard coordinates
    DB-->>Guest: Contextual hazard & floor plans
    Guest->>AI: Request dynamic safe evacuation route
    AI-->>Guest: Stream step-by-step turn-by-turn navigation instructions
    Note over Guest: Render layout and active evacuation instructions
```

### Evacuation Generation Pipeline

1. **Hazard Mapping**: The system identifies the hazard's exact location (floor, sector, room).
2. **Context Compilation**: Active threats, safe zones, and building coordinates are compiled.
3. **AI Generation**: The Google Gemini model processes the context and computes step-by-step navigation instructions avoiding hazard zones.
4. **Real-time Streaming**: Evacuation instructions are fed directly to affected users' SafeStay portals.

### Resource Inventory Pipeline

1. **Local Adjustments**: Admins adjust inventory levels (supplies, safety kits) in local draft mode.
2. **Capacity Assessment**: The UI recalculates progress bars and status indicators based on active thresholds.
3. **Batched Synchronization**: When saved, updates are packaged into a batched Firestore commit.
4. **Terminal Sync**: State is propagated to all open administrator dashboards.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle: Display current resource capacity
    Idle --> DraftMode: Admin starts adjusting inventory levels
    DraftMode --> UIProgressBars: Calculate resource status locally
    UIProgressBars --> DraftMode: Edit further
    DraftMode --> SaveAction: Click "Save & Sync"
    SaveAction --> FirebaseSync: Fire batched Firestore write
    FirebaseSync --> UpdatedState: Real-time update broadcasted
    UpdatedState --> Idle: Synced across all Admin terminals
```

## 📊 Understanding Results

### Incident Severity Levels

- 🔴 **Critical**: Immediate life-safety threat (e.g., active fire). Evacuation protocols engaged.
- 🟠 **High**: Significant operational disruption requiring urgent response.
- 🟡 **Medium**: Warning state. Situation under observation.
- 🟢 **Low**: Minor issue or resolved incident. Sky is clear.

### Resource Status

- **Nominal**: Resource levels are at or above 80% capacity.
- **Warning**: Resource levels are dropping.
- **Depleted**: Critical shortage in specific sectors requiring immediate restock.

## 🧪 Example Usage

### Running a Mock Drill

1. Navigate to the **Admin Operations** view.
2. Open the sidebar and click **Mock Crisis**.
3. The system will simulate a critical event (e.g., Fire in Sector Alpha).
4. Switch to the **Guest Guide View** to see the automated SOS and evacuation instructions appear in real-time.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Technologies Used

1. **Frontend Framework**: [React 19](https://react.dev/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
2. **Styling & Animation**: [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) + [Framer Motion](https://motion.dev/)
3. **Backend & Infrastructure**: [Firebase v12](https://firebase.google.com/) running on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
4. **Generative AI & Tooling**: 
   - **Google Gemini** (via GenAI SDK)
   - **Google AI Studio** for rapid prompt engineering
   - **Google Vertex AI** for enterprise scalability
5. **Agentic Assistant**: Google DeepMind's **Antigravity**
6. **Data Visualization**: [Recharts](https://recharts.org/)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **Role-Based Access**: Separation between Sentinel Admin views and Guest Guide views.
- **Anonymous Guest Auth**: Quick, secure check-in without storing permanent PII.
- **Real-Time Data Sync**: Encrypted database connections via Firebase.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Firebase Connection Errors
Ensure your Firebase configuration in `firebaseService.ts` matches your active Firebase project settings and that your Firestore rules allow read/write access during development.

### Gemini API Not Responding
Verify your `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env.local` is correct and has not exceeded its quota.

### Port Conflicts
If port 3000 is taken, Vite will try the next available port. You can force a port by editing the `dev` script in `package.json`:
```json
"dev": "vite --port=3001"
```
