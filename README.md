**NexusResponse** is a next-generation crisis coordination and emergency resource management system. Built for facility administrators and emergency responders, it provides real-time situational awareness, dynamic resource tracking, and automated guest guidance during critical events to ensure rapid, coordinated responses.

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-Time Operational Dashboard**: Monitor facility status, active incidents, and core services at a glance with a high-fidelity "Sentinel" UI.
- **Resource Inventory Engine**: Floor-wise allocation tracking for essential supplies (linens, safety kits, medical, water) with direct Firebase synchronization.
- **Responder Unit Management**: Track deployment status, commander assignments, and active sectors for all security and emergency personnel.
- **Guest Guide Interface (SafeStay)**: A guest-facing portal providing interactive facility maps, SOS features, and dynamic evacuation routes during an emergency.
- **System Activity Logging**: Comprehensive transaction and event history for the NexusResponse Hub.
- **Visual Demo Mode**: Includes an immersive presentation mode simulating crisis coordination capabilities.
- **AI Integration**: Dynamically generated, context-aware evacuation routes powered by Google Gemini.

## 📋 Requirements

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- Firebase Project setup (Firestore, Auth)
- Google Gemini API Key
- Modern Web Browser

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Technomaniac143/NEXUS-SMART-RESPONSE.git
cd NEXUS-SMART-RESPONSE

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your keys:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
# Add Firebase config variables if using a separate backend instance
```

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will automatically open or be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by Vite).

## 🎯 Platform Capabilities

### Operations Control
- Incident Monitoring
- Live Threat Assessment
- Field Unit Deployment
- Real-time Operations Logs

### Resource Tracking
- Automated Supply Counting
- Floor-by-floor Allocation
- Quick-draft Updates & Syncing

### Guest Assistance
- Turn-by-turn Evacuation Guidance
- SOS Emergency Signaling
- Facility Exploration Map

## 🔬 How It Works

### Crisis Detection Pipeline

1. Threat reported or mock crisis triggered
2. System logs event to Firebase Firestore
3. Real-time listeners update the Admin Dashboard
4. Automated alerts are dispatched to the Guest Interface

### Evacuation Generation Pipeline

1. Threat location identified (floor, room)
2. Safe routes calculated away from the hazard zone
3. Gemini AI generates structured, step-by-step instructions
4. Instructions stream directly to affected users' SafeStay portals

### Resource Inventory Pipeline

1. Admins input or adjust inventory levels in draft mode
2. Visual progress bars reflect current capacity vs. nominal capacity
3. Upon save, batched updates are sent to the database
4. Facilities remain synced across all connected Admin terminals

## 📊 Understanding Results

### Incident Severity Levels

- 🔴 **Critical**: Immediate life-safety threat (e.g., active fire). Evacuation protocols engaged.
- 🟠 **High**: Significant operational disruption requiring urgent response.
- 🟡 **Medium**: Warning state. Situation under observation.
- 🟢 **Low**: Minor issue or resolved incident. Sky is clear.

### Resource Status

- **Nominal**: Resource levels are at or above 80% capacity.
- **Warning**: Resource levels are dropping.
- **Depleted**: Critical shortage in specific sectors requiring immediate restock.

## 🧪 Example Usage

### Running a Mock Drill

1. Navigate to the **Admin Operations** view.
2. Open the sidebar and click **Mock Crisis**.
3. The system will simulate a critical event (e.g., Fire in Sector Alpha).
4. Switch to the **Guest Guide View** to see the automated SOS and evacuation instructions appear in real-time.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Technologies Used

1. **Frontend Framework**: [React 19](https://react.dev/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
2. **Styling & Animation**: [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) + [Framer Motion](https://motion.dev/)
3. **Backend & Real-time Database**: [Firebase v12](https://firebase.google.com/)
4. **Generative AI**: [Google GenAI SDK](https://github.com/google/gemini-nodejs)
5. **Data Visualization**: [Recharts](https://recharts.org/)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **Role-Based Access**: Separation between Sentinel Admin views and Guest Guide views.
- **Anonymous Guest Auth**: Quick, secure check-in without storing permanent PII.
- **Real-Time Data Sync**: Encrypted database connections via Firebase.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Firebase Connection Errors
Ensure your Firebase configuration in `firebaseService.ts` matches your active Firebase project settings and that your Firestore rules allow read/write access during development.

### Gemini API Not Responding
Verify your `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env.local` is correct and has not exceeded its quota.

### Port Conflicts
If port 3000 is taken, Vite will try the next available port. You can force a port by editing the `dev` script in `package.json`:
```json
"dev": "vite --port=3001"
```
